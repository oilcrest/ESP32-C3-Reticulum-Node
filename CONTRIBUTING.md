# Contributing to ESP32-C3-Reticulum-Node

Thank you for contributing! Please follow these guidelines to keep the project healthy.

- Use small, focused PRs — one feature or fix per PR.
- Add unit tests for protocol parsers and logic where possible.
- Update docs (`docs/`) when behavior or APIs change.
- Ensure `pio run -e esp32-c3-devkitm-1` completes locally before opening a PR.
- CI must pass before merging.

Pull request checklist:
- [ ] Code compiles and tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated (README / docs/)
- [ ] New public symbols documented in headers
- [ ] Security considerations noted (if applicable)

Maintainers may request changes or split large PRs into smaller pieces.
