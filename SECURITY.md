# Security Policy

If you discover a security issue, please follow responsible disclosure:
- Do not open a public issue. Instead contact the maintainers privately (open a private GitHub security advisory).
- Include steps to reproduce, affected versions, and suggested mitigations.

Security recommendations for deployers:
- Use HTTPS when exposing the Web UI remotely.
- Enable Secure Boot / Flash Encryption on supported hardware when used in untrusted environments.
- Verify OTA images with signatures before installing (planned feature).
